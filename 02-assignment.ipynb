In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. Deep learning libraries such as keras and pytorch are also allowed.  You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

The first step towards building a language model is to collect the vocabulary, i.e. the set of unique word types in our training data.

    "**Instructions**: As we'll be building a trigram neural language model (based on lecture 7, page 20), the next step is to collect trigrams to construct our training data. In a trigram neural language model, for example if we have the trigram _cow eats grass_, the input to the model is the first two terms of a trigram (_cow_ and _eats_), and the language model's aim is to predict the last term of the trigram (_grass_). Your task here is to construct the training and development data for the language model. Just like the previous step, the first 12K paragraphs will serve as our training data, and the remaining 3K+ will be for development. You'll need to map words into IDs when constructing the training and development data. Any words that are not in _vocab_ should be mapped to the special _$<$UNK$>$_ symbol.\n",

    "   - You should ignore sentences that have less than 3 words (as they are too short to form trigrams).\n",
    "   - We won't need special starting symbol when collecting the trigrams, as we are only interested in learning word embeddings here (and not computing probabilities of a sentence).\n",

For this, you can use the Pearson correlation co-efficient (`pearsonr`), which is included in scipy (`scipy.stats`). Be careful converting your dictionaries to lists for this purpose, the data for the two datasets needs to be in the same order for correct comparison using correlation. Write a general function, then apply it to each of the similarity score dictionaries.\n",
